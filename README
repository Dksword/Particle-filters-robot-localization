README

The goal of the assignment (CMU Robotics Institute, 2014) was to become familiar with robot localization and particle filtering. I
implemented a global localization filter for a lost robot (global meaning that you do not know the initial
pose of the robot) using C++ and OPENCV. 

The lost robot is operating in Wean Hall with nothing but odometry and a laser rangefinder. Fortunately,
there is a map of Wean Hall to help it localize. The data directory has the following files:
• instruct.txt – Format description for the map and the data logs.
• robotdataN.log.gz – Five data logs (odometry and laser data).
• wean.dat.gz – Map of Wean Hall to use for localization.
• wean.gif – Image of map (just for your info).
• bee-map.c – Example map reader from BeeSoft that you may use if desired.
• robotmovie1.gif – Animation of data log 1 (just for your info).
